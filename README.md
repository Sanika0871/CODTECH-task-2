Overview of the Project 

Objective-
The objective of the Student Grade Tracker project is to create a tool for students or educators to efficiently manage and track grades for various subjects or assignments. 

The program aims to:

Simplify the process of recording and analyzing grades.

Automatically calculate the average grade and GPA.

Provide insights into academic performance by displaying the overall grade in numerical and letter formats.

Key Activities-
Input Management:

Allow users to input grades for multiple subjects or assignments.

Validate user inputs to ensure accuracy.

Grade Calculation:

Compute the total and average grades.
Determine the letter grade based on predefined criteria (e.g., A, B, C, D, F).
Calculate the Grade Point Average (GPA) on a 4.0 scale.

Output Presentation:

Display the computed results in a clear and concise format.
Provide feedback on performance (e.g., average grade, letter grade, GPA).

Error Handling:

Manage invalid inputs (e.g., negative grades or non-numeric values).
Handle edge cases such as zero subjects or division by zero.

Scalability:

Allow tracking of grades for a variable number of subjects.
Extendable for more features, such as weighted grades or storing grade history.


Technologies Used-

Java Programming Language:

Core language used for implementing the logic, managing user input/output, and processing data.

Java Standard Library:

Scanner: For input handling from the user.

Control Structures (if, switch, for loop): For logical operations and decision-making.

Arrays: To store and process multiple grades efficiently.

Development Tools:

JDK (Java Development Kit): To compile and run the program.

Text Editor/IDE: Such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code for writing the code.

Command Line/Terminal: For compiling and executing the Java program.

GPA Calculation Logic:

Implements a simple formula to map percentage scores to a 4.0 scale GPA.

Future Enhancements
Integrate with databases (e.g., MySQL) to store grade history.

Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better usability.

Support for weighted grades or subject-specific credits.
Export grades and performance reports to files (e.g., CSV or PDF).
